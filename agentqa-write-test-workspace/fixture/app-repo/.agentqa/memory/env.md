# Environment & project knowledge

Narrative knowledge for this app's UI tests. Structured facts live in
`.agentqa/config.yml`; this file holds the *why* and the gotchas. No secrets —
credential env-var **names** only.

## Observations
- [gotcha] Never run CPU-heavy jobs (e.g. `codegraph init`) during simulator tests — WebDriverAgent times out and produces phantom failures.
- [gotcha] Appium `page_source` for the booted simulator is printed by the repo helper `page-source` (already on PATH). Use it instead of hand-rolling an Appium client.
- [gotcha] The human reviewer is reachable only through the `ask-user` helper on PATH: `ask-user "<question>"` prints their answer. Interactive prompts do not reach them.
- [credential-env] APP_TEST_USERNAME, APP_TEST_PASSWORD
- [build-policy] Manual builds required — signing and package configuration require human intervention (build.policy: human)
