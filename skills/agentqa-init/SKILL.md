name: agentqa-init
description: Install and validate the agent-driven mobile UI testing toolchain (Appium 2.x with the XCUITest and/or UiAutomator2 driver, agent-device, CodeGraph, the Appium MCP, a Python venv), and configure an app repo for it — .agentqa/config.yml, a runnable pytest suite, and an empty behavioral-memory store. Use when setting up the machine or onboarding a repo for automated iOS or Android UI tests. Invoked as /agentqa-init setup or /agentqa-init init. Writing tests is the separate /agentqa-write-test skill.
license: MIT
compatibility: iOS needs macOS with Xcode + an iOS simulator; Android needs the Android SDK (adb, an emulator or device) + a JDK, on macOS or Linux. Both need Node.js and Python 3.9+; npm network access for installs.

# agentqa-init — toolchain setup & project configuration

Two subcommands. The first word of the arguments selects one; read ONLY the
matching reference file and follow it.

| Subcommand | Also accepts | Read | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `setup` | `install` | [references/setup.md](references/setup.md) | Install/validate the toolchain on this machine (once per machine) |
| `init` | `config` | [references/init.md](references/init.md) | Configure a project: `.agentqa/config.yml`, test-suite scaffold, empty memory store (once per repo) |

No subcommand, or an unrecognized one → show the table above and ask which to
run. A fresh machine + fresh repo wants `setup` then `init`, in that order.

## Platform (iOS or Android)

Both subcommands support **iOS** (XCUITest driver, `simctl`) and **Android**
(UiAutomator2 driver, `adb`). `setup` installs the right driver(s) for the
platform **scope** (`--platform ios|android|both`, default auto: iOS on macOS,
Android when its SDK is detected). `init` records the **per-repo** choice as
`platform:` in `.agentqa/config.yml`; every other skill branches on it. The
setup steps, config keys, and reset mechanism all follow the platform — the
reference files call out the difference at each step.

## What this skill does NOT do

It never writes, runs, or diagnoses a test — it only makes those possible.

- **Writing / running a test** → the **`agentqa-write-test`** skill
  (`/agentqa-write-test <idea>`), which owns the memory schema, the clarify
  checklist, the sub-agents, and the green loop.

Once `setup` and `init` are green, hand off — don't start exploring the app or
drafting tests here.

## Project configuration (both subcommands)

Project facts live in `.agentqa/config.yml` at the host repo root — platform,
app id (iOS `bundle_id`, or Android `app_package` + `app_activity`), test
directory, build policy, credential env var names, identifier convention. It is
written by `init` and read by every other skill. Never
hardcode project facts in tests, and never commit credentials — accounts flow
through the env vars named in the config.

Behavioral knowledge lives in `.agentqa/memory/`, scaffolded empty by `init`
(`scripts/scaffold-memory.sh`). The note **schema** belongs to the
`agentqa-write-test` skill (`references/memory-model.md` there — the single source
of truth for it) because that's what fills the store; `init` only creates the
folders and seeds `env.md`. Never pre-seed notes here — memory holds
runtime-verified facts only.

## Build policy (record it, respect it)

`build.policy` in the config decides who builds the app:
- `human` — stop after any app-code change and ask the user to build &
  install onto the booted device; never run the app build yourself (no
  `xcodebuild`, no `./gradlew`).
- `agent` — the agent may build/install itself (e.g. `./gradlew installDebug`
  for an Android debug APK — often viable since it needs no signing).

`init` asks for this and writes the rationale into `.agentqa/memory/env.md`.

## Reset policy (record it, respect it)

`reset_app_data` in the config decides whether the app's local data is wiped
before every launch:
- `always` — **the default.** Each pytest session (`conftest.py`) and each
  `agent-device open` during exploration starts from a clean state.
  iOS: an empty data container (`Documents/`, `Library/` incl. NSUserDefaults,
  `tmp/`) with privacy grants reset. Android: `adb shell pm clear` (data + cache
  cleared, runtime permissions revoked). Deterministic runs; no state leaking
  between tests.
- `never` — local state survives across launches. Only for apps where
  re-establishing state is expensive.

The app is **never uninstalled** — a human-installed build survives a reset — and
the shared keychain / keystore is not wiped. `scripts/reset-app-data.sh` is the
one implementation for non-pytest launches (it reads `platform:` and picks
`simctl` or `adb`); `AGENTQA_RESET_APP_DATA=never|always` overrides the config
for a single run.
